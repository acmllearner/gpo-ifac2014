Particle Bayesian optimisation for parameter inference in nonlinear state space models

This code was downloaded from < https://github.com/compops/bayopt > or from < http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/johda87/code.html > and contains the code used to produce the results in the poster for

*J. Dahlin and F. Lindsten,
Bayesian Optimisation for Parameter Inference.
ERNSI Workshop 2013,
Nancy, France, September 2013.
*

The the poster with the example (generated by this code) is found at < http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/johda87/presentations.html >.

Requirements
--------------
The program is written in Matlab 2013a and uses the GPML toolbox for the Gaussian process modelling. The GMPL toolbox is available for download from http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/.


Included files
--------------

**RUNME**
Executes the Matlab program that reproduces the plot in the poster for the Stochastic volaility model. The only difference to the poster is that N=500 particles are used with T=500 data points (this to speed up the execution, the results are good enough using this setting).

**pf**
Runs a bootstrap particle filter with systematic resampling to estimate the log-likelihood.

**datagen**
Generates data from a general state space model given function handles and the input.
